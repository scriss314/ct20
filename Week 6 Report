Last week and the week before have been a bit of a struggle, but I was still playing around. With Learing HTML and learning more of Blender and how to add shades without the coding and add it to P5 is fun, but can be frustrating with how much. HTML so far has its
ups and downs. Im able to understand, while sometimes struggling of adding the words, using color and shading without trying to break the code. I have not gotten into adding the video or audio yet, but I plan to this week since I have been a bit behind on my other code 
and dealing with a game developer as a producer as a volunteer. I'm really curious to see what else we will be learning as the winter quarter comes to an end. The stuff I have added for my progress report is the HTML and the Blender Practice.
