Week Jan 19-25
During this week, I was learning to practice the Wall Art and still working on the 3D art, where i kinda make a solar system type of art. im still working on the image background since its pitch black, but the actual image has some color in it. I'm still learning to code
But it has been a bit slow due to also taking another coding class, but dealing with science. Overall, I'm taking my time slowly. Learning the code and what each does so that I understand enough. I'm pretty excited to start on my first code project, but I'm nervous about 
what the project will be about. The only thing that is still sorta confusing for me is just understanding the function, and it's like Python.
